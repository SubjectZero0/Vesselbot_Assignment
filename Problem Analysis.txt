Here, I am going to describe the problem as I understand it.

--Let points be a collection of planar spatial data(2D space). Then:

    -If tile38 allows for the addition of a timestamp on these points:
    
        1) does tile38 perceive timestamps as an additional dimension, or,

        2) does tile38 simply add a timestamp as "alphanumerical" data?

        3) can events(cross, enter, exit and inside) derive time data based on these timestamps?


Plan of attack:

1)Create add 2D point with a timestamp FIELD.
2)Create a roaming Geofence with a timestamp FIELD.
3) SETHOOK to DETECT events
4)Assert if:
    -Events have timestamps. If they do:
        -is the timestamp a completely new one, or is it one of the previously defined ones?

To be continued...
